# Setup
```
bundle install
ruby src/start.rb
```
### Instructions
After running start.rb select your color mode and enter your name. You will be shown a selction on quotes that you need to type as fast as possible. Afterwards  you will be shown statistics about how you went.

# Build process
Our primary aim was to create a program that would test the users typing speed and accuracy testing them on  randomly generated quotes. It would check the original quote against the one that the user wrote and return an accuracy percentage and a total words per minute.
Our secondary goal was to save the users statistics between sessions.

# Purpose
This application may be used as a typing trainer where data is saved to the individual and may be called upon to see user progress.

# Structure
The program's functionality was split into 3 Classes, Game, Input and User. This allowed us to abstract some of the complexity of the functions away, making the code more readable. It has the added benefit of encapsulating variables that were only used in specific functions (eg. only storing the file path in the User class).
The classes were put in separate files to enhance the readability of the code. The Input class pulls the data from 'faker' and saves it to an array that the Game class can use.  The Game class is used to call the methods that make up the main functionality, displaying the quotes and getting user input. The User class holds data related to the long term statistics of the user, to load and save this data between sessions.
Apart from the main application loop, almost all of the functionality was put into methods. This allowed us to repeat certain sections of code over again, this part was particularly useful for the accuracy compare function. This function was broken into two parts, one to check each word and one part (letter_accuracy), to check each letter. This made a complex function easier to read and debug.

# Functionality
1. Pulls a selection of quotes from the Faker Gem.
2. Present the quotes one by one to the user and save get there attempt.
3. Run test to determine how many errors the user has.
4. Return the users total Words Per Minute and accuracy.
5. Save the user data between sessions.
